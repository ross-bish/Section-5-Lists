# Negative indices 

These can be used on lists in just the same way as they could be used on strings. 

The last element of a Python list has an index of ``âˆ’1``. Working backwards, the index of each element is one less than its predecessor. 

Therefore, the valid indices for a list made up of four elements would be ``[âˆ’4] -> [-1]`` or ``[0] -> [3]`` inclusive. 

This is illustrated below.

## Task 4
ğŸ‘‰ Can you use negative indexing to access elements of the List on the previous page.

````py
fruits = ['Strawberry', 'Lemon', 'Orange', 'Raspberry', 'Cherry']


````
ğŸ‘‰ Add lines to the code above to print the 1st and 3rd element of the list using *negative indexing*.
