# Lists and Strings 📚

In Python, there is a variable type called a list. 

A list can be used to store a collection of data items, and to keep them in order if necessary. Using lists means that the laborious task of coding the same instructions over and over again, on many items of data, can be avoided.

A list begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket, e.g. ``[0, 1, 2, 3]`` or ``["red", 
"green", "blue"]``. 

Values inside the list are referred to as items / elements and are separated from each other using commas `,`.

## Creating a List
- The simplest kind of list is an empty list. This consists of a set of square brackets with nothing in between, i.e. ``emptyList=[]``.

- The string “Frank Lampey” is not a list, but it is easy to convert it into one as follows:
````py
myString = "Frank Lampey"
print(myString)
myStringList = list(myString)
print(myStringList)
````

- As you can see, it is just like converting a string to an integer or float, only in this case we use the ``list()`` function.

👉 Try the code above in `main.py` and see what the output is.

💡 *Note: When printed in Python, a list is defined as having 
square brackets at the start and end, and a comma separating 
each item.*

- In terms of variable type, ``myString`` is of variable type string but ``myStringList`` is of variable type list. Add the following lines to your code to show this:
````py
print(type(myString))
print(type(myStringList))
````

The output now includes these lines:
````
<class 'str'>
<class 'list'>
````
