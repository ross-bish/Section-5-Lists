# Lists - Modify Task 👨‍💻

## What’s a **Modify** task?

- In the modify tasks, you are given some starter code.
Use the instructions below to make changes to the code.
- ``# comment`` your changes to explain what you have done.

## Steps
Adapt the code to:

1. Add ``"Minecraft"`` to the start of the list.

2. Ask the user to input a number between `0` and `4` and store it in a variable.  Output the item at this position in the list.

3. Ask the user to input the name of a video game and store it in a suitable variable.
   - If this video game is in the list then *remove* it from the list.
   - If it isn't in the list then *add* it to the end.
