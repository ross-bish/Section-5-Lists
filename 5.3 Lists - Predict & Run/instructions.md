# Lists - Predict and Run Task ✍👨‍💻

## What’s a **Predict & Run** task?

In this task you are given a sample of code as shown below:

````py
# Sample Code

Sentence = ["Always", "look", "on", "the", "bright", "side", "of",]
print(Sentence)
print(Sentence[1])
Sentence.append("life")
Sentence[4] = "sunny"
print(Sentence[4])
print(Sentence[0] + " " + Sentence[3])
print(Sentence)
````

- Look at each line, study it carefully.  
- Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs.  Your prediction should be added to the code as ``#comments``.
- You should use the key terms *"list", "item"* and *"index"* in your predictions.
- Run the code, compare what happens to your prediction.
- Add comments to note down any differences between your prediction and what actually happens.

## List Operations - Reference Table 📚
- Create a new list called `sweets[]`
- Add some of your favourite sweets to this list *e.g.*
  ````py
  sweets = ["M&Ms", "Skittles", "Dairymilk"]
  ````
- Experiment with the operations shown below. 👇


| Operation         | Description                                 | Sample Code |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output item       | Outputs a single item from the array        | `print(arrayName[itemIndex])` <br> Example: `print(sweets[3])` |
| Edit item         | Changes or replaces an item in an array.    | `arrayName[itemIndex] = "New data"` <br> Example: `sweets[1] = "Haribo"` |
| Add an item       | Puts a new item onto the end of the array   | `arrayName.append("new data")` <br> Example: `sweets.append("Galaxy")` |
| Remove an item    | Removes an item from the array              | `arrayName.pop(itemIndex)` <br> Example: `sweets.pop(2)` |
| Output all items  | Outputs every item in the array one by one using a loop | `for i in range(0, len(arrayName)):` <br> `print(arrayName[i])` <br> Example: <br> `for i in range(0, len(sweets)):` <br> `print(sweets[i])` <br><br> **💡Note:** <br> You need to know how to do the for-loop version for the exam. <br><br> You can also use: <br> `print(sweets)` |



## 🤔Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- The list name is identical everywhere it is used (capital letters  matter)
- List index is surrounded by *square* brackets `[ ]`
- List indexing starts at *zero* `[0]`- are you counting properly?
