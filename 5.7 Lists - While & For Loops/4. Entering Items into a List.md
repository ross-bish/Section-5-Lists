# Entering items into a list 📚

- In the following example, we will ask the user to enter the 
number of pets that they have.
- The user will then be prompted to enter the name of each pet. When all of the names have been entered, the program will print a list of the pets’ names. Try the following:
````py
petList = []
totalPets = int(input("How many pets do you have? "))
````

- We start by creating an empty list `petList = []`. This will be used to store each pet name after it has been entered.
- We use the variable ``totalPets`` to record how many pets the user has. We need to know this so that the prompt is displayed the correct number of times.
- Add this line:
````py
if totalPets > 0: 
````
- We need this statement to take account of the possibility that the user has no pets. If this is the case, the above condition will evaluate to ``False`` and the program will display an appropriate statement about *"not having pets"*.

- However, if the user has a pet, the condition will evaluate to 
``True`` and the following ``for`` loop will be used to prompt 
the user to input each pet name.

## Task 👨‍💻

Write some for loops to accompany the code above so your program does the following:
1. Ask how may pets they have.
2. Using a `for` loop, prompt them to keep entering their pet names for the number of pets the have.
3. Use a `for` loop to print the names of all the pets in their list `petList = []`.

## 👀 Hint
Your output should look something like this:
````
How many pets do you have? 3
Enter pet's name: Arya
Enter pet's name: Ted
Enter pet's name: Fluffy

The names of your pets are:
Arya
Ted
Fluffy
````
