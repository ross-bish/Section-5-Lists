# List Concatenation & Replication ðŸ“š

- List concatenation and replication work in a similar way to strings.
- To concatenate two lists, type the following into `main.py`:
````py
flowerList = ["Buttercup","Daisy", "Rose"]
treeList = ["Oak", "Beech", "Yew", "Hazel"]

newList = flowerList + treeList
print(newList)
````
- We can also use concatenation to extend an existing list as 
follows:
````py
firstList = ["a", "p", "n"]
secondList=["O", "h", "Y", "z"]

firstList = firstList + secondList
print(firstList)
````
- And to replicate a list, type these lines:
````py
flowerList = ["Buttercup", "Daisy", "Rose"]

newList = flowerList * 2
print(newList)
````

ðŸ’¡ *Remember: In Python, a list can contain a mixture of different variable types.*

ðŸ‘‰ Create some examples of these yourself in `main.py` and experiment with using list *"concatenation and replication"* on the mixed lists.
````py
my_mixed_list = [ ] 
````
