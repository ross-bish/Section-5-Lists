# Modifying a list using a while loop. 📚

- In a similar way to the previous example, we can use a 
``while`` loop to check that no item in a list has a value of less 
than zero *(i.e. a negative number)*, and if it has, set it to 0. 

- Try the following code in `main.py`:
````py
# create your list
myList = [1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
print(myList)

counter = 0

# The indentation within this While loop is very important!
while counter < len(myList):
  if myList[counter] < 0:
    myList[counter] = 0
  counter += 1
print(myList)
```` 
💡*Note: that we are modifying each negative item directly, using its index.*

✍ Try to predict the correct output in your copy / in the ``# comments``.

Removing negative numbers in this way is an example of *"data 
pre-processing"* and will be covered further in Chapter 3.
