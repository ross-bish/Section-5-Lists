# Using for loops with lists. 📚

- There are many ways to use ``for`` loops with lists.
- One of the simplest is to print out each item in the list separately.
- Type these lines into `main.py`:
````py
myList = [1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
print(myList)

for item in myList:
 print(item)
````

- Your output should look like:
````
[1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
1
-19
27
8
-5
9
````
💡*Note: the different output between using `print(myList)` and using `print(item)` inside the `for` loop.*

- The `for` loop repeats the code block for each item in the list.
- You may remember from earlier in the chapter that ``print()`` defaults to adding a new line each time the function is used.

## Modifying lists with a for loop – *beware* ❗

- We have already successfully used a while loop to check that no value in a list is less than 0 and if it is, to set it to 0.
- Now, let’s try to do this using a for loop.
- Try the follwoing code:
````py
myList = [1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
print(myList)

for item in myList:
  if item < 0:
    item = 0
print(myList)
````
## Are we getting the correct output? 🤔

Here is the output:
````
[1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
[1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
````
But this is _not_ what we want! 
We wanted to replace any negative value _(i.e. less than 0)_ with 0.

- Our mistake was to use the variable ``item`` for each item in 
the list and then again inside the `for` loop.
- When used inside the loop, Python regards it as a _local variable_.
- If it is modified, the original list is not – another example of a bug. 🐛
- To modify a list item using a for loop, we must go to the list and modify the item directly using its index. Look back at how we did this using the while loop.
- Here is the correct way to replace the negative values using a ``for`` loop:

````py
# Removing negative values from a list using a for loop.

myList = [1, -19, 27, 8, -5, 9]
print(myList)

for counter in range(len(myList)):
  if myList[counter] < 0:
    myList[counter] = 0
print(myList)
````
## 🕵️‍♂️ Does the output match your prediction??
