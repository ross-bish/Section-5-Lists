# List Operators 📚

### Using ``in`` and ``not`` in operators with lists

We have already come across the in operator with the 
``range()`` function when we were using for loops. 
We can use ``in`` and ``not in`` to check whether an item is or is not in a list. 

For example, consider:
````py

if 'a' in ['t', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'u', 'p']:
 print("It is in the list.")
````

💡 *Note: the expression has a value to look for in a list, in 
this case 'a', and the list where it may be found.*

This type of expression will evaluate to a *"Boolean"* value. In the above case, it will evaluate to ``True``.

## Task 1: 👨‍💻

In this example, the user types in the name of the make of a car and then the program checks to see whether the name is in a list of cars. 

Type the following lines into `main.py`:
````py
# Create a list of different car models 

myCars = [ ]

carName = 

if carName not in myCars:
 print("We do not stock", carName)
else:
 print("Yes, we stock", carName)
 ````

👉 Add some car models to the list `myCars =  [] `

👉 Prompt the user to enter a car name.

👉 Search the list of cars to see if that car is in `myCars` or not.
