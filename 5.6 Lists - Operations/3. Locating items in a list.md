# Finding the location of an item in a list. 📚

- Let’s return to our original list and find out the location of the value 27. We can do this using the ``index()`` function.
- Type these lines:
````py
myList = [1, 19, 27, 8, 5, 9]
print(myList.index(27))
````
- Your output should be: 
````
2
````
👉 Experiment by appending 27 to the list. It now appears in 
two locations. 

- What happens when you use ``index()`` to find the location of 27?

- The output is the same as before. Python only finds the location of the first item. We saw something similar occur with strings earlier in the chapter.
- How can we find a way around this?

## Locating items that occur more than once.

- In the list shown, we can find out the number of times that the number 27 occurs and the location of each one by using a ``while`` or a ``for`` loop.
- Try the following:
````py
myList = [27, 33, 9, 27, 8, 5, 27]
numSought = 27
````

- The value of the item being sought, "27", is assigned to the variable 
numSought.
- Add the following lines:
````py
freqNum = 0
counter = 0
````

- We will use ``freqNum`` to record each occurrence of 27 and 
``counter`` to control the number of times the ``while`` loop 
is executed. 
- Both of these variables are initialised above.
  
- Type the following lines for the ``while`` loop:
````py
# create the while loop

while counter < len(myList):
 if myList[counter] == numSought:   # what does this line do?
  freqNum += 1                      # what does this line do?
  print("Found at index: ",counter)
  counter += 1                      # what does this line do?
 ````
 
💡 *Note that ``freqNum`` is only incremented if 27 is found but ``counter`` is incremented each time until its value is equal to 
the number of items in the list ``len(myList)``.*

- Finish off by adding the following to display the number of 
times that 27 appears in the list:
````py
print(numSought,"found", 
freqNum,"times.")
````

- Your output should look like this:
````
Found at index: 0
Found at index: 3
Found at index: 6
27 found 3 times.
````

Keep note of this useful piece of code. 
You will need it in Chapter 3 for ALT2 (Applied Learning Task 2), which 
requires you to find the frequency of a number in a list.

## Task 2: 👨‍💻
👉 Repeat the exercise above using a ``for`` loop.
